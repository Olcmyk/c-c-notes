# c-notes
只是一些非常基础的语法知识，我是看的郝斌老师的视频，可以去b站上搜。It's only some basic knowledge.I have watched Hao Bin's videos. You can watch it on Bilibili.

我当初学c语言真的费了很多，但是也没有学的很好。我想提醒大家，就像学习英语一定要开口说话一样，学习c语言最重要的是 敲。只有在敲代码的过程中才能看出自己的问题，进而再去百度或是谷歌，。
我会的也没有很多，把一些笔记同步在这里。
基础知识我倒是已经学完了，现在在复习并学习数据结构。

I spent a lot of time learning C language, but it was not very good. I want to remind everyone that just like learning English must speak, the most important thing to learn c language is knocking. Only in the process of typing the code can you see your problems, and then go to Baidu or Google.
I do n’t know much. I ’ll sync some notes here.
I have already learned the basics, and now I am reviewing and learning data structures.
